            "[Ticket Note] Completed offboarding checklist: disabled account, removed group memberships, confiscated questionable desktop backgrounds. Another glorious victory for IT.",
            "[Ticket Note] Offboarding complete. User's AD account sent off with a Viking funeral (but with less fire). All access is revoked, licenses reassigned to someone marginally more grateful.",
            "[Ticket Note] User access terminated with extreme prejudice (and a little confetti). Devices locked down, mailbox archived, karma mostly intact.",
